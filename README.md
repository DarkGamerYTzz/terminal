### Server Requirements
Your server can have two optional channels:
> **terminal-logs**

**This is used for logs** which can be enabled by doing the command: "logs on". If logs is enabled and there is no channel, it will report to the channel the action has taken place in.

> **terminal-reports**

**This is used for reports and tickets**. If there is no reports channel, all tickets and reports will go to the channel the report has taken place in.
